# Presets
You can save any combination of Render Raw settings as custom presets. A presets folder must be set in the add-on preferences before this feature can be used. 

To overwrite a preset, save it with the same name as the previous preset. Default presets will be reset by Render Raw if you disable the add-on, enable it again, and point it to the same presets folder.
