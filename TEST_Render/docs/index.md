**Render Raw** is a Blender add-on for perfecting the colors in your render. 

You can download Render Raw by [purchasing it on Superhive (formerly Blender Market)](https://blendermarket.com/creator/products/render-raw/?ref=806). 
 
Watch **[this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS7uaTquwWc)** for an overview of why colors in Blender can be challenging and how the raw workflow is important to getting the colors you want without editing in external software. 

For an in-depth review and workflow example, check out [Gleb Alexandrov's color correction crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywG5b2ZDiQ8&pp=0gcJCccJAYcqIYzv) which uses Render Raw. 

The minimum supported Blender version is 4.1. It will work with 4.0 albeit with a few bugs since the viewport compositor recieved several stability fixes in Blender 4.1.
